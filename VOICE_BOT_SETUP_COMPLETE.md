# Voice Bot Setup Instructions

## âœ… Issues Fixed

1. **Voice Bot Persistence**: Fixed hydration error and voice bot now stays active across page navigation
2. **Eleven Labs Integration**: Updated API integration with proper error handling
3. **Speech Recognition**: Improved error handling for browser speech recognition
4. **Command Handling**: Enhanced support for explain commands and close commands

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup

âœ… **Eleven Labs API key is now hardcoded** - No environment setup needed!

Optional: Create a `.env.local` file for Gemini API:

```env
# Gemini API (Optional - for better AI responses)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

If no Gemini API key is provided, the voice bot will use intelligent fallback responses.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Now Working

- **Navigation**: "Take me to pricing", "Go to products", "Show me contact page"

- Messages history is maintained

### Audio Processing
- Eleven Labs TTS for natural speech output

- Intelligent error handling and fallbacks

## ðŸ”¥ How to Test

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Click "Talk to AVA" button in header
