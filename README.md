## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**:
- This is a demo implementation using client-side authentication
- Password is hardcoded for demonstration purposes
- Data is stored in localStorage (not suitable for production)
- For production use, implement:
  - Server-side authentication
  - Secure password hashing
  - Database storage
  - HTTPS encryption
  - Session management
  - Rate limiting

## Customization

### Changing the Password
Edit the password in:
- `app/admin/login/page.tsx` (line with password check)
- `hooks/use-auth.ts` (login function)

### Adding New Fields
1. Update the `Organization` interface in `app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`
2. Add form fields in `components/organization-form.tsx`
3. Update the form validation logic
4. Modify the organization card display

### Styling
- All styling uses Tailwind CSS classes
- Custom components are in `components/ui/`
- Theme can be customized in `tailwind.config.js`

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure you're using the correct password
4. Clear localStorage if experiencing authentication issues
